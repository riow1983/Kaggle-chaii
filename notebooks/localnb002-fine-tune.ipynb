कैल्शियम युक्त खोल स्रावित करता है जो एक मांसल विरासत है चारों ओर यह आंतरिक हो सकता है हालांकि खोल कम या अनुपस्थित है आमतौर पर बाहरी है । जाति आम तौर पर ९ या १० वर्गीकरण वर्गों में बांटा गया है जिनमें से दो पूरी तरह से विलुप्त हैं । मोलस्क का वैज्ञानिक अध्ययन मालाकोलोजी कहा जाता है । ये प्रवर में बंद रहते हैं । साधारणतया स्त्राव द्वारा कड़े कवच का निर्माण करते हैं । कवच कई प्रकार के होते हैं । कवच के तीन स्तर होते हैं । पतला बाह्यस्तर कैलसियम कार्बोनेट का बना होता है और मध्यस्तर तथा सबसे निचलास्तर मुक्ता सीप का बना होता है । मोलस्क की मुख्य विशेषता यह है कि कई कार्यों के लिए एक ही अंग का इस्तेमाल होता है । उदाहरण के लिए दिल और गुर्दे प्रजनन प्रणाली है साथ ही संचार और मल त्यागने [SEP] मोलस्क की प्रजातियों में रहने वाले वर्णित अनुमान कितने प्रजातियों का है [SEP]  | pred: \n","ground
